# Portfolio Website

The code for my personal portfolio website. Projects will continuously be updated.

My name is Abbie Murphy, I am a recent Brandeis University graduate with both a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science. I have a strong full-stack foundation through building web and mobile apps and integrating RESTful APIs. Lately I have been diving into database architecture and distributed systems, and I love thinking through system design at scale. I am also drawn to data science and machine learning, and have worked with databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Redis with a focus on sound schema design and performance.
